<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 31 yo and I live in Naples, where I am born. </p>
<p>I love sports since ever, i do Kick boxing, Kitesurf, Calistenichs and I have recently started practicing Brazilian Jujitsu also! </p>
<p>I have a dog, Zeus, a big Cane Corso that is 2 yo. </p>
<p>I work in the bikini and swimwear industry — we produce everything here in Campania, so all our products are 100% Made in Italy. I sell them through my e-commerce store, <a href="https://mishmishswimwear.com/">www.mishmishswimwear.com</a></p>
<p>Working on my own e-commerce taught me a lot about websites and online business. About two years ago, I started creating websites for friends and helping others solve technical issues or improve their online presence. That’s when I realized this could become a real career — one that makes me feel fulfilled, independent, and free to manage my own time, projects, and work location. I can work from anywhere!</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve decided to take my self-taught skills to the next level and become a professional web developer. I’ve started enrolling in top-quality courses to learn from the best professionals in the field.</p>
